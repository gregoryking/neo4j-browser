[[sidebar]]
== Sidebar

The sidebar contains a set of drawers where you can set up the environment for graph management and exploration.

* Database Information - contains information about the currently used node labels, relationship types, and property keys. +
Clicking on any one of those options runs a quick query to show you a sample of the graph with those elements.
* Favorites - allows you to bookmark your queries as favorites.
//https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*WxSIQfG5d3alMsd6.png
//   Local scripts
//   Sample scripts
// GK review comment - Note Project files is similar to favorites, but made available via Desktop and only available when Browser is run from Desktop
* Project Files -
* Browser Sync - allows you to synchronize your favorites, styling, and settings to cloud storage, so you can share it across machines and browsers.
* Help and Learn - contains useful commands, built-in guides, links to documentation, notifications, and a send feedback button.

//   Notification Bell, Canny: Latest Updates
* Browser Settings - provides Browser settings.
* About Neo4j - shows the Neo4j Browser version, license information, and provides a link to a link to Neo4j Browser Changelog.

[[database-info]]
=== Database Information

The Database Information drawer provide information about the data of the currently used database, the logged-in user's roles, the Neo4j DBMS version, as well as, some basic Cypher queries and administrative commands.
A typical scenario of using that drawer is

//TODO: To write a short paragraph about each of the drawers using https://neo4j.com/developer/neo4j-browser/.

[[favorites]]
=== Favorites

// https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*WxSIQfG5d3alMsd6.png

Favorites are used to save scripts (Cypher queries and commands) to be easily reused.
Favorites can be organized into folders.

. Create or update your favorites.
. Create a new empty favorite.
. Individual favorite changes.
. Bulk favorite changes.

There are local scripts and sample scripts.

The name of the script is the first line of the script.
To control the name use a comment as the first line.

The example shows a script that will have the name likes candy in favorites.

.Favorite: Likes candy

[source, cypher]

[[guides]]
==== Built-in guides

Neo4j Browser provides many interactive guides for learning concepts and tools with Neo4j.
From data import to graph algorithms to working with RDF data, there is likely an interactive browser guide out there to walk through it.
If there is not one that fits your needs, you can create one and publish it to the community or internally at your company.
For more information on how to do that, see link:https://neo4j.com/developer/guide-create-neo4j-browser-guide/[creating a custom Browser guide].

Some guides ship with Neo4j Browser out-of-the-box, no matter what system or installation you are working on.
The Browser built-in guides are quick guides that introduce different Neo4j concepts.
You can find more helpful links in the left sidebar of Neo4j in the "Documents" tab ().
To pin a particular pane to the top of the window (under command line) so that it stays at the top when you run queries after it, just click the pushpin button ().
This is especially helpful for pinning guides to the top so they do not get pushed down to the bottom of the window as you run queries.

|===

All you have to do is enter any of the above commands in the Browser command line (at the top of the pane) and follow the accompanying guides to walk through the training or scenarios.
Guides are presented as slideshows that can be navigated by clicking the forward and back arrows in the pane to progress to the next or previous slide.
To execute any of the queries provided within a Browser guide, simply click on the query, and it will populate in the command line.
Then, just press *Enter* or the *Play* button to execute the statement.
Results of the query populate in a panel right below the command line.

[TIP]
====
There are also other guides, which are created by Neo4j staff and community members to help others learn Neo4j or how to use the tools in its ecosystem. +
You can check out the currently published list on the link:https://portal.graphgist.org/graph_guides[GraphGist Portal (Graph Guides section)]. +

[[settings]]
=== Browser Settings

// https://neo4j.com/developer/neo4j-browser/#browser-config
The defaults for all the settings can be adjusted at any time by going to the configuration option on the left-side menu.
Some possible config changes and views are the following:

* You can retrieve the current configuration with `:config`.
* Individual settings are configured with the following defaults:
** `:config maxNeighbours:100`- maximum number of neighbours for a node
** `:config maxRows:100` - maximum number of rows for the tabular result

You can also see the current status on your database, such as store sizes, ID allocation, page cache, and transaction info by using the command `:sysinfo` in the editor.
//https://dist.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/sysinfo_stats.png

To override the configuration settings -> https://neo4j.com/developer/kb/how-do-i-override-browser-configuration-settings/

// GK review - proposing fuller explanation
When you execute a query, any relationships not explicitly returned by the query, but that exist between the nodes it reurns will be shown in the graph.  This behaviour is conrolled by the `Connect result nodes` in *Settings*.  You can disable for queries where it is important to only see the relationships the query returns.

Configuration settings can be set in _neo4j.conf_ or if using Neo4j Desktop, navigate to the DBMS which settings you want to update, click the ellipsis dropdown menu, and select *Settings*.

[[editor]]
== Cypher editor

The Cypher editor is the primary interface for entering and running commands.
From Neo4j Browser 4.2.4, the Cypher editor is based on Monaco link:https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/[https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/], the editor that powers VS Code link:https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode[https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode].

Some of its features include:

* Syntax highlighting
** A smart highlight of matching pairs around the current position of the cursor, for example, matching brackets, braces, and parenthesis.
** A smart highlight of identical words on a word click.
You can select them by pressing *Command + D* (one occurrence at a time) or by command+shift L (all occurrences).
* Command palette (F1)
* Quick comment/uncomment
* Moving query parts around
* Folding and indentation


* Cypher queries to work with graph data.
* Client-side commands like `:help` for other operations.
* REST request commands (`:GET`, `:POST`, `:PUT`, and `:DELETE`).
* Single line editing for brief queries or commands.
* Switch to multi-line editing with *<Shift-Enter>*.
* Run a query with *<Ctrl-Enter>* or *<Cmd-Enter>*.
* History is kept for easily retrieving previous commands.
* Autocomplete for browser commands.
* Move focus to the editor with /.
* Toggle the editor to full screen with ESC.

Use the command `:help keys` for information about keyboard shortcuts.

[[frames]]
== Result frames

[[frame-views]]
=== Result frame views

* Graph - Display the result as nodes and relationships. Styling can be configured.
* Table - Display the result as JSON formatted rows.
* Text - Display the result as a plain text table.
* Code https://browser.graphapp.io/assets/images/screen_code_frame.png - View the requests and responses.

[stream]
=== Stream

// https://browser.graphapp.io/assets/images/screen_stream.png

Scrolling series of frames (mostly reusable result frames).

A reusable result frame is created for each command execution, added to the top of the stream to create a scrollable collection in reverse chronological order.

Remove all the frames from the stream with the :clear command.

[[reusable-frames]]
=== Reusable result frames

Cells with results that you can reiterate on.

Now, when you need to edit the query of an existing result frame to fix a mistake, you can do that directly in the result frame and update the results in situ.

The reusable frame maintains its own local history of commands as well as updating the main Cypher editor, should you need to instantiate a new result frame from there.
